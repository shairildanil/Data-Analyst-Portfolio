About Me  
I am a tenacious and self-driven Physics graduate from the National University of Singapore with practical experience in research and data analysis. For my final year project, I obtained one of the first few experimental data for the electrical property of a compound known as palladium diselenide. Seeking to contribute my analytical abilities, strong attention to details and proven leadership capabilities in an entry-level data analyst role where I can apply my research and analytical skills to provide strategic insights towards formulating government policies.

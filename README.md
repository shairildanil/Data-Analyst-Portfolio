# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
### About Me  
I am a tenacious and self-driven Physics graduate from the National University of Singapore with practical experience in research and data analysis. For my final year project, I obtained one of the first few experimental data for the electrical property of a compound known as palladium diselenide. Seeking to contribute my analytical abilities, strong attention to details and proven leadership capabilities in an entry-level data analyst role where I can apply my research and analytical skills to provide strategic insights towards formulating government policies.  
### Projects  
##### Visualization of Chicago Traffic Data  
Found here: https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/jTQ7i8zdoJk  
Note: As public data is not updated in real-time, user has to change the time period to 'Last Quarter' to get information from the dashboard.  
This personal project involves the visualization of large volumes of raw data from BigQuery's public source Chicago taxi data and desigining a dashboard on Google Analytics from it. The aim of the dashboard is to display vital information that would be useful for a government offical looking to have a in-depth but quick rundown on the Chicago taxi industry.  
  
Geospatial heat map of taxi demand were generated through the use of the GPS coordinates of the taxi's pickup location. High demand locations are O'Hare International Airport, the CHocago Loop and Lincoln Park. The dashboard can also be sorted based on companies as well as type of payment used.  
  
There is a clear cyclical trend in the demand of Chicago taxis. Every Sunday, there is a peak in median fair, probably due to it traditionally being a day to spend with family. And yet, the total trips on Sunday follows an opposite trend, falling to a low quanity compared to the rest of the week. Therefore, lesser people are travelling by taxi on Sundays, but those that do are travelling further, enough so that it accounts for the drop in demand and resulting in the large increase in median fare for that day.  
  
##### Final Year Project: Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Non-Centrosymmetric 2D Crystals.  
The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is the process in which a steady photocurrent is produced within a homogeneous material lacking centrosymmetric properties without the need of an initially applied potential difference. In this paper, I examine the BPVE in the non-centrosymmetric 2D material Palladium Selenide, or PdSe2. This research project involved the fabrication of pure PdSe2 crystal flakes on Si wafers, the collection of data regarding its physical and electrical properties using atomic force microscopy, Second Harmonic Generation Mapping and direct laser interaction as well as data sorting using SQL and visualization of the photocurrent produced through Matlab.  
  
##### International Physicists' Tournament Submission: Jumping Bean  
This team proejct required us to study the movements of a 'jumping bean' toy and mathematically model and explain its movements. Due to the limited time and resources avaiable, we had to devise of an experimental setup with what materials were avaiable to the team. As such, the lack of proper equipments for the experiment may have resulted in less than expected results that did not confine strongly to the theoretical model that was formulated.

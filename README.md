# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
### About Me  
I am a tenacious and self-driven Physics graduate from the National University of Singapore with practical experience in research and data analysis. For my final year project, I obtained one of the first few experimental data for the electrical property of a compound known as palladium diselenide. Seeking to contribute my analytical abilities, strong attention to details and proven leadership capabilities in an entry-level data analyst role where I can apply my research and analytical skills to provide strategic insights towards formulating government policies.  
### Projects  
##### Visualization of Chicago Traffic Data  
Found here: https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/jTQ7i8zdoJk
  
Note: As public data is not updated in real-time, user has to change the time period to 'Last Quarter' to get information from the dashboard.  
  
This personal project involves the visualization of large volumes of raw data from BigQuery's public source Chicago taxi data and desigining a dashboard on Google Analytics from it. The aim of the dashboard is to display vital information that would be useful for a government offical looking to have a in-depth but quick rundown on the Chicago taxi industry.  
  
Geospatial heat map of taxi demand were generated through the use of the GPS coordinates of the taxi's pickup location. High demand locations are O'Hare International Airport, the CHocago Loop and Lincoln Park. The dashboard can also be sorted based on companies as well as type of payment used.  
  
There is a clear cyclical trend in the demand of Chicago taxis. Every Sunday, there is a peak in median fair, probably due to it traditionally being a day to spend with family. And yet, the total trips on Sunday follows an opposite trend, falling to a low quanity compared to the rest of the week. Therefore, lesser people are travelling by taxi on Sundays, but those that do are travelling further, enough so that it accounts for the drop in demand and resulting in the large increase in median fare for that day.  
  
##### Final Year Project: Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Non-Centrosymmetric 2D Crystals.  
The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is the process in which a steady photocurrent is produced within a homogeneous material lacking centrosymmetric properties without the need of an initially applied potential difference. In this paper, I examine the BPVE in the non-centrosymmetric 2D material Palladium Selenide, or PdSe2. This research project involved the fabrication of pure PdSe2 crystal flakes on Si wafers, the collection of data regarding its physical and electrical properties using atomic force microscopy, Second Harmonic Generation Mapping and direct laser interaction as well as data sorting using SQL and visualization of the photocurrent produced through Matlab.  
  
##### International Physicists' Tournament: Jumping Bean  
This team proejct required us to study the movements of a 'jumping bean' toy and mathematically model and explain its movements. Due to the limited time and resources avaiable, we had to devise of an experimental setup with what materials were avaiable to the team. As such, the lack of proper equipments for the experiment may have resulted in less than expected results that did not confine strongly to the theoretical model that was formulated.  
  
##### Miscellaneous Data Analysis Work
This folder consists a selection of experiments I have conducted throughout my 4 year course in Physics. These experiments constitutes the seting up of experiments to collect data regarding physical phenomena. These data are then analyzed using Excel to produce relationships and R-square values to prove the theories that were being tested. These demonstrate my comfortability with data and numbers as well as my ability to collect and clean data using Excel so as to generate meaningful insights.  
  
a) Band Gap of Germanium with Cobra3  
This experiment seeks to find the ebergy gap of a Germanium strip. 
  
b) Faraday Effect  
This experiment seeks tp determine the angle of rotation of the polarization-plane of the polarized light through a ﬂint glass rod as a function of the mean-ﬂux density using diﬀerent colored ﬁlters, calculate their corresponding Verdet’s constant in each case as well as evaluate Verdet’s constant as a function of the wavelength and the optical medium.  
  
c) Cardanic Gyroscope  
This experiment seeks to determine the precession frequency as a function of the torque and the angular velocity of the gyroscope as well as the nutational frequency as a function of the angular velocity and the moment of inertia.  
  
d) Magnetic Moments  
This experiment seeks to find the torque of the magnetic moment in a uniform magnetic field as a function of the strength of the magnetic field, as of the angle between the magnetic field in the magnetic moment.  
  
e) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  
This experiment seeks to determine the line width of the flourine resonance, the g-factor of protons and flourine as well as demonstrate the nuclear magnetic resonance on protons and flourine in liquid and solid samples.  
  
g) Zeeman Effect  
This experiment seeks to determine the distance between two adjacent interference when there is no magnetic flux density, B, distance between two adjacent interference when there is no magnetic flux density for varying B as well as the relationship between magnetic flux density against current flowing through the coils.
